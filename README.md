# sdl_minesweeper

A simple, incomplete version of minesweeper written in C++ using SDL2 and the code that was used for the minesweeper solving algorithm. This is a side project used to gain familiarity with SDL2 and get an introduction to C++ graphics.

Controls:
- Flag a square with SPACE
- Reveal a square with MOUSE1
- Reveal all neighbors with SPACE (on a square that is revealed and has the correct number of flags surrounding it)
- Restart the game with R
